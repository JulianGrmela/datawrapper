    <p>Families marched outside of Tweed Courthouse last Thursday to demand better student transportation. They said there must be a school-bus driver shortage, since their kids experience long waits and rides.</p>

<p>Governor Kathy Hochul announced plans to address the statewide shortage in September, but Mayor Bill de Blasio denies a shortage in New York City.</p> 

<p>“There definitely is a school bus driver shortage,” said David Christopher, the executive director of the New York Association for Pupil Transportation. “This has been an ongoing problem due to low wages, increased regulation and a poor perception of the job by people looking for work.”</p>

<p>He said an informal survey conducted by NYAPT showed wages for drivers varied by locality, but ranged from $15-30 per hour.</p>

<p>Nationally, school bus drivers earn about $4-per-hour less than transportation workers in other industries.</p>

<p>Christopher estimates there are 10-15% fewer school-bus drivers in NYS than there were pre-pandemic. He said some left for safety fears, while the increased demand for package-delivery drivers created more options for drivers.</p>
<p>Advocates at Tweed Courthouse said the city must acknowledge the alleged shortage, then provide better wages and benefits to attract drivers so their kids can get to school.</p>
